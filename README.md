# **Solar Power Plant Performance Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of a solar power plant by evaluating power generation trends, inverter efficiency, and identifying anomalies in energy production. The insights derived from this analysis can help optimize energy output, reduce inefficiencies, and improve predictive maintenance strategies.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains power generation readings from a solar plant with multiple inverters. It includes timestamped records of DC power, AC power, daily yield, and total yield.

 
### **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy  
### **Project Type:** Data Analysis & Visualization  


### **Key Features:**
- **DATE_TIME:** Timestamp of recorded power readings.
- **PLANT_ID:** Unique identifier for the solar plant.
- **SOURCE_KEY:** Identifier for different inverters.
- **DC_POWER:** Direct current power generated by solar panels (in kW).
- **AC_POWER:** Converted alternating current power output (in kW).
- **DAILY_YIELD:** Total energy generated by the plant on a given day (in kWh).
- **TOTAL_YIELD:** Cumulative energy generated by the plant over time (in kWh).

## **Objectives**
- Analyze **daily and seasonal power generation trends**.
- Compare **DC power vs. AC power efficiency** to evaluate inverter performance.
- Identify **anomalies or inconsistencies in power generation**.
- Provide **recommendations for performance optimization**.

## **Data Preprocessing**
- Converted **DATE_TIME** to a datetime format for time-series analysis.
- Checked for **missing values and duplicates**.
- Created **new features** for deeper insights (e.g., hourly trends, efficiency ratios).

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
### **Key Findings:**
1. **Power Generation Trends:** Peak generation occurs between mid-morning and early afternoon.
2. **DC vs. AC Power Efficiency:** Inverters cause slight conversion losses, affecting total output.
3. **Daily & Seasonal Yield Analysis:** Some unexpected drops in power generation indicate possible malfunctions or weather disruptions.
4. **Correlation Between Features:** AC power is strongly dependent on DC power, while yield trends indicate efficiency fluctuations over time.

## **Visualizations & Techniques Used**
- **Line Plots:** To analyze power generation over time.
- **Scatter Plots:** To compare DC vs. AC power efficiency.
- **Box Plots:** To observe variations in power generation.
- **Heatmaps:** To identify correlations between different power metrics.

## **Business Impact & Recommendations**
1. **Optimize Solar Panel Positioning** ‚Äì Adjust panel angles for maximum sunlight exposure.
2. **Monitor & Replace Low-Performing Inverters** ‚Äì Identify and replace inefficient inverters to reduce energy loss.
3. **Implement Predictive Maintenance** ‚Äì Use anomaly detection to predict and prevent breakdowns before they occur.
4. **Integrate Weather Data for Forecasting** ‚Äì Improve predictions by incorporating weather conditions into the analysis.

## **Challenges Faced**
- Handling missing data and ensuring accurate time-series formatting.
- Identifying external factors affecting power generation.
- Evaluating efficiency across different inverters.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Develop a **machine learning model** to predict power generation based on weather conditions.
- Build a **dashboard** in Power BI for real-time monitoring.
- Implement an **automated alert system** for detecting inverter failures.

## **Conclusion**
This project provides valuable insights into optimizing solar power generation. By analyzing trends, identifying inefficiencies, and implementing corrective measures, solar plants can significantly enhance their performance and operational efficiency.
