✨ Key Insights
Peak Power Generation Times: Solar power generation peaks between 10 AM and 2 PM across most plants.
Seasonal Impact: Power generation is highest during summer months, with an average increase of 20% compared to winter months.
Performance Disparities: Certain plants consistently outperform others, suggesting potential inefficiencies or geographical advantages.
Power Loss Trends: Identified an average of 15% power loss during rainy seasons, likely due to reduced sunlight exposure.
Outliers in Power Output: Sudden drops in power generation were observed in Plant C, signaling potential equipment issues.
Maximizing Output: Plants utilizing optimized solar panel angles increased their power generation by 10% on average.
✨ Features
🌍 Interactive Filters: Filter data by solar plant, date range, or power output dynamically.
📊 Insightful Visualizations: Line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots provide a clear view of trends and performance metrics.
⚖️ Plant Performance Comparison: Compare generation across different plants or timeframes.
📅 Time-Series Analysis: Analyze solar power generation daily, monthly, or seasonally.
📝 Top KPIs & Insights: Key insights are highlighted to help stakeholders make informed decisions.
🎨 Design Decisions & Assumptions
Handling Missing Data: Missing data points were removed to ensure clarity, and outlier data points were visualized but noted.
Focus on Visuals: As this is a data analysis project, no database or backend was implemented—pure focus on insights and visual analytics.
Scalability: The app was built with scalability in mind, allowing for additional solar plants to be added easily.
